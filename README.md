# Python-File-Sorter
Sorts files in subdirectories of the main dir of PFS (Python File Sorter) 

This is still constantly updating do not expect this to be bug friendly
It automatically sorts when you run it but before that you need to change what directory you want to sort (Default : Desktop)
Instead of getting paid i will just release my software for free.
